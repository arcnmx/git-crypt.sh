# git-crypt.sh

[![travis-badge][]][travis] [![license-badge][]][license]

A reimplementation of [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) as a bash
script.


## Feature set

Supported subcommands:

- `init`
- `unlock` with an explicit keyfile.
- `export-key`
- `smudge`, `clean`, `diff` for git integration

Most notably, there is no support for the additional GPG functionality of
`git-crypt`.


## Dependencies

Bash (not just any portable POSIX shell), and the OpenSSL 1.0.x+ CLI tool. OpenSSL
0.9.x (as is included on OS X) is supported but will encounter issues with key files
generated by `git-crypt` that contain any null bytes.


## Performance

It's slow. Use the real `git-crypt` if possible, this is meant to be used as a
stop-gap measure.
